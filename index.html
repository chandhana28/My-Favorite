    <p> My favorite hobby is Singing. Singing helps me focus and calms my mind down. I love to sing and learn new songs everyday. Singing is apart of me and my daily life. When you sing there is no right or wrong way. There are many songs in many languages. I mostly sing Telugu songs, but soemtimes I sing English songs. A fun fact about singing is you can live longer if you sing! Can you imagine a day without singing? Cause I can't imagine a day without singing. 🎤🎶🎵❤️🙂 </p>
